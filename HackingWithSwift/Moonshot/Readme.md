# SwiftUI Course - Image Handling, ScrollView, Navigation, Lazy Grids, and JSON Decoding

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing the app with image resizing, scroll views, navigation stacks, lazy grids, and decoding JSON data from a local file.

## How it was done:
### Resizing Image:
- Implemented functionality to resize images within the app.
- Ensured images fit well within the designated UI components.

### Introducing ScrollView:
- Introduced `ScrollView` for both horizontal and vertical scrolling.
- Enabled users to scroll through content seamlessly in both directions.

### Using NavigationStack with NavigationLink:
- Utilized `NavigationStack` to manage navigation hierarchies.
- Implemented `NavigationLink` to push views within a list, facilitating navigation between different parts of the app.

### Basic Usage of LazyHGrid and LazyVGrid:
- Added `LazyHGrid` and `LazyVGrid` for efficient horizontal and vertical grid layouts.
- Demonstrated how to create dynamic and responsive grid-based interfaces.

### Decoding Data from JSON Local File:
- Implemented functionality to decode data from a local JSON file.
- Ensured the app can read and utilize structured data stored in JSON format.

## What I learned:
- **Image Resizing**
- **ScrollView (Horizontal and Vertical)**
- **NavigationStack and NavigationLink**
- **LazyHGrid and LazyVGrid**
- **Decoding JSON Data**

# SwiftUI Course - AsyncImage, Form Validation, JSON Decoding, and URL Requests

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on loading images, validating forms, decoding JSON, and sending network requests.

## How it was done:
### Load Image from Remote Server Using AsyncImage:
- Loaded images asynchronously from a remote server using `AsyncImage`.

### Validate Forms Using .disabled:
- Validated forms by conditionally disabling form elements using the `.disabled` modifier.

### Decoding Objects Using CodingKeys:
- Decoded JSON objects with custom keys using the `CodingKeys` protocol.

### Sending Requests Using URLSession:
- Sent network requests and handled responses using `URLSession`.

## What I learned:
- **AsyncImage**
- **Form Validation with .disabled**
- **JSON Decoding with CodingKeys**
- **URLSession for Network Requests**

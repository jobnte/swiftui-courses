# SwiftUI Course - Core Data Section Skipped

## Reason for Skipping:
The Core Data section of the SwiftUI course has been skipped because its content was already covered in-depth using SwiftData in Project 11 (Bookworm) and Project 12 (SwiftData).

### Summary:
- **Redundant Content**: The topics in the Core Data section overlap significantly with those covered using SwiftData in previous projects.
- **SwiftData Implementation**: Projects 11 and 12 provided comprehensive coverage of data persistence, management, and operations using SwiftData, which offers similar functionality to Core Data.

By skipping this section, the focus remains on exploring new and unique concepts, ensuring a more efficient and valuable learning experience.

# SwiftUI Course - Navigation, Error Handling, Image Processing, Context Menus, Data Storage, and QR Code Handling

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing the app with tab-based navigation, error handling, image processing, context menus, swipe actions, data storage, and QR code handling.

## How it was done:
### Use of TabView:
- Implemented `TabView` to provide tab-based navigation within the app.

### Use of Result Type:
- Utilized the `Result` type for improved error handling and clearer code.

### Use of .interpolation Modifier for Images:
- Applied the `.interpolation` modifier to control the scaling quality of images.

### Use of contextMenu for Additional Actions on a View:
- Implemented `contextMenu` to provide additional actions for views.

### Add Swipe Actions:
- Added swipe actions to list items, enhancing interactivity and functionality.

### Use SwiftData to Store Data:
- Utilized `SwiftData` for efficient and persistent data storage within the app.

### Creating QR Code Using CIFilter.qrCodeGenerator:
- Created QR codes using the `CIFilter.qrCodeGenerator`.

### Read QR:
- Implemented functionality to read and decode QR codes.

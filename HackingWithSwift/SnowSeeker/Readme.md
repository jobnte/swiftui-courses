# SwiftUI Course - Navigation, Notifications, Search, Data Handling, and Accessibility

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing navigation, notifications, search functionality, data handling, and accessibility features.

## How it was done:
### Two Side Views Content Using NavigationSplitView:
- Implemented `NavigationSplitView` to create two side views for better navigation and content organization.

### Using .alert and .sheet:
- Added `.alert` for displaying alert messages to users.
- Used `.sheet` for presenting modal views.

### Use Groups as Containers:
- Utilized `Groups` to organize and contain multiple views for better code structure.

### Add Searchable View Modifier:
- Applied the `searchable` view modifier to add search functionality to views.

### Decode Data from Local JSON:
- Implemented data decoding from a local JSON file to populate the app with data.

### Presenting Default View for Split View:
- Configured a default view to be displayed in the `NavigationSplitView`.

### Implement Environment Variable dynamicTypeSize:
- Used the Environment variable `dynamicTypeSize` to adjust the app's text size dynamically for better accessibility.

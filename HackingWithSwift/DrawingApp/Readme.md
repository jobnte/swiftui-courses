# SwiftUI Course - Custom Shapes and Drawing Techniques

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on understanding the difference between Path and Shapes and implementing various custom shapes and drawing techniques.

## How it was done:
### Understand Path vs Shapes:
- Learned the distinction between `Path` and `Shapes` in SwiftUI for creating graphics.

### Implement Custom Shapes:
- Created several custom shapes including:
  - **Triangle**: Defined a custom shape for a triangle.
  - **Arc**: Implemented an arc shape for partial circles.
  - **Flower**: Designed a custom flower shape.
  - **ColorCycling**: Applied color cycling effects to shapes.
  - **Trapezoid**: Created a trapezoid shape with adjustable parameters.
  - **Spirograph**: Developed a spirograph shape for intricate patterns.

## What I learned:
- **Path vs Shapes**
- **Custom Shapes (Triangle, Arc, Flower, Trapezoid, Spirograph)**
- **ColorCycling**

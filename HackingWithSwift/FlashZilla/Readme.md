# SwiftUI Course - Accessibility, Gestures, Timer, Scene Phase Detection, and Hit Testing

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing the app with accessibility features, various gestures, timer functionality, scene phase detection, and hit testing control.

## How it was done:
### Use of Accessibility Label / Hint:
- Added accessibility labels and hints to provide better context for screen readers.

### Using Gestures:
- Implemented various gestures including tap, long press, pressing, magnify, and rotate to enhance interactivity.

### Use Timer:
- Utilized a timer to perform scheduled actions within the app.

### Use of @Environment(\.scenePhase):
- Used @Environment(\.scenePhase) to detect when the app moves to the background, becomes inactive, or returns to active state.

### Use Drag Gesture:
- Implemented drag gesture to allow users to interact with and move elements within the app.

### Use allowsHitTesting:
- Applied allowsHitTesting to control whether views should respond to user interactions.

## What I learned:
- **Accessibility Labels and Hints**
- **Various Gestures (tap, long press, pressing, magnify, rotate)**
- **Timer**
- **@Environment(\.scenePhase) for App State Detection**
- **Drag Gesture**
- **allowsHitTesting**

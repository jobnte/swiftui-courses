# SwiftUI Course - List Actions, Toolbar Buttons, Data Persistence, Sorting, and Custom Rating Component

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on implementing list actions, toolbar buttons, data persistence with SwiftData, sorting data, and creating a custom rating component.

## How it was done:
### Use List with Actions Like onDelete:
- Implemented `List` with actions such as `onDelete` to allow for item deletion.

### Use Toolbar Buttons to Perform Different Actions:
- Added buttons to the toolbar to perform various actions, enhancing the app's interactivity.

### Persist Data Using SwiftData:
- Persisted data using `SwiftData`, including setting up a container and performing basic operations for data storage.

### Use Query to Sort Data from SwiftData:
- Used `Query` to sort data retrieved from `SwiftData`, ensuring the data is presented in a structured manner.

### Create Custom Rating Component:
- Developed a custom rating component to allow users to rate items within the app.

# SwiftUI Course - Enhancing Accessibility Features

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on improving the app's accessibility features to make it more user-friendly for individuals with disabilities.

## How it was done:
### Use of Accessibility Input Labels:
- Added accessibility input labels to provide better support for screen readers.

### Use of Accessibility Traits:
- Applied accessibility traits to UI elements to convey more information about their behavior and usage.

### Use of Accessibility Hidden:
- Used accessibility hidden to hide certain elements from screen readers, reducing clutter and focusing on important information.

### Use of Accessibility Element Children:
- Combined child views using accessibility element children to present them as a single accessible element.

# SwiftUI Course - Layout Management and Positioning

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing layout management and positioning using various SwiftUI features.

## How it was done:
### Use Frame to Define Custom Width and Height:
- Defined custom width and height for views using the `frame` modifier.

### Use Alignment in a Frame View Modifier:
- Applied alignment within the `frame` modifier to position content.

### Create Custom Alignment Guide:
- Created custom alignment guides for precise control over view alignment.

### Positioning Views Using Position (x, y):
- Positioned views at specific coordinates using the `position` modifier.

### Use Offset to Move View:
- Moved views by applying the `offset` modifier.

### Use GeometryReader to Get the Value of the Screen/Container:
- Utilized `GeometryReader` to obtain dimensions and positions of the screen or container.

### Use of scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned):
- Applied `scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)` to align views within a scroll view.

## What I learned:
- **Custom Frames (Width and Height)**
- **Alignment in Frame View Modifier**
- **Custom Alignment Guide**
- **Positioning Views with Position (x, y)**
- **Offset Modifier**
- **GeometryReader**
- **scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)**

# SwiftUI Course - Data Management, State Handling, MapKit, Biometrics, and MVVM

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing the app with data writing, view state management, map integration, biometric authentication, gesture recognition, and introducing the MVVM pattern.

## How it was done:
### Writing Data into Documents Directory:
- Implemented functionality to write and save data into the app's documents directory.

### Switching View States with Enums:
- Used enums to manage and switch between different view states such as loading, success, and failed.

### Integrating MapKit:
- Integrated `MapKit` to add map functionalities, allowing users to view and interact with maps within the app.

### Unlock App Using TouchID/FaceID:
- Enabled biometric authentication using TouchID/FaceID to unlock the app, enhancing security and user experience.

### Use of OnLongPress:
- Added `OnLongPress` gesture recognizer to trigger actions upon long press gestures.

### Introducing Basic MVVM Pattern:
- Introduced the basic Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to improve code organization and separation of concerns.

# SwiftUI Course - Advanced State Management, Data Persistence, and UI Enhancements

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on integrating advanced state management, data persistence, string formatting, conditional styling, and modal presentation.

## How it was done:
### Using @Observable:
- Integrated `@Observable` for improved state management across views.
- Enabled reactive updates and better handling of state changes.

### Using Dismiss Environment Variable:
- Utilized the `dismiss` environment variable to handle view dismissals.
- Provided a seamless way to close views programmatically.

### Using @AppStorage:
- Implemented `@AppStorage` to manage user defaults and persist data efficiently.
- Simplified data storage and retrieval within the app.

### Using Formatters to Format Strings:
- Applied formatters to format strings based on specific requirements.
- Ensured consistent and localized string representation.

### Applying Different Text Styles Based on a Condition:
- Added conditional text styles to dynamically change the appearance of text elements.
- Enhanced the UI by applying styles based on certain conditions.

### Presenting a View Using .sheet:
- Presented views using the `.sheet` modifier for modal presentations.
- Enabled users to view additional content in a modal format.

## What I learned:
- **@Observable for State Management**
- **Dismiss Environment Variable**
- **@AppStorage for Data Persistence**
- **String Formatters**
- **Conditional Text Styles**
- **.sheet for Modal Presentation**

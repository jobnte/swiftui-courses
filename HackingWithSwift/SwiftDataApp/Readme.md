# SwiftUI Course - Data Management with SwiftData and CloudKit Integration

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing data management using SwiftData and integrating CloudKit for data synchronization.

## How it was done:
### Create Containers in SwiftData:
- Set up containers in `SwiftData` to manage the application's data storage.

### Implement a Form to Create Objects:
- Developed a form to create new objects, allowing users to input and submit data.

### Basic CRUD Operations with SwiftData:
- Performed basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using `SwiftData`.

### Use Filter in SwiftData:
- Applied filters in `SwiftData` to retrieve specific subsets of data based on given criteria.

### Manage Relationships Between Objects:
- Established and managed relationships between different data objects in `SwiftData`.

### Use CloudKit:
- Integrated `CloudKit` to enable data synchronization across multiple devices, ensuring consistent and up-to-date data.

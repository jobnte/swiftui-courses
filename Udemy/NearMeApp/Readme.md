# SwiftUI Course - Section 22: Apple Stocks App - Listing Stocks on the Screen

## What was done:
Section 22 of the SwiftUI course focused on building an Apple Stocks App that lists stocks on the screen by integrating an API and using various SwiftUI and UIKit techniques.

## How it was done:
### Implementing API of Stocks:
- Integrated a stock market API to fetch real-time stock data.
- Parsed the API response to display stock information in the app.

### Using Offset to Change Position of Views:
- Applied the `.offset` modifier to adjust the position of views dynamically.
- Demonstrated how to use offsets for layout adjustments and animations.

### Changing Appearance Using UIKit Methods:
- Leveraged UIKit methods to customize the appearance of SwiftUI views.
- Applied UIKit techniques to achieve a specific look and feel for the stock listings.

### Filtering Data:
- Implemented filtering functionality to allow users to search and filter stock data.
- Ensured the filtered results were dynamically displayed in the list.

## What I learned:
- **API Integration**
- **Offset Modifier**
- **UIKit Customization**
- **Data Filtering**

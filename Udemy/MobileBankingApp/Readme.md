# SwiftUI Course - Section 32: Freestyle Apps

## Section Skipped: Freestyle Apps

### Reason for Skipping:
The "Freestyle Apps" section of the SwiftUI course was skipped because it consists of videos showing the coding process at an increased speed without any narration or explanation, making it difficult to follow and understand the steps involved.

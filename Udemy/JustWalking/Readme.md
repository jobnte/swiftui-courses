# SwiftUI Course - Section 29: SwiftUI Pedometer

## What was done:
Section 29 of the SwiftUI course focused on using CoreMotion to read and display the user's steps.

## How it was done:
### Using CoreMotion (CMPedometer) to Read Steps:
- Implemented `CMPedometer` from CoreMotion to access pedometer data.
- Demonstrated how to read the number of steps taken by the user and display this information in the SwiftUI application.

## What I learned:
- **CoreMotion CMPedometer**

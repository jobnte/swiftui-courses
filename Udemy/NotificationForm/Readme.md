# SwiftUI Course - Section 15: Forms

## What was done:
Section 15 of the SwiftUI course continued to focus on enhancing forms by incorporating picker views and lists.

## How it was done:
### Using Picker View in Forms:
- Implemented a `Picker` view within a form to allow users to select from multiple options.
- Configured the `Picker` with various choices to demonstrate its functionality.

### Using List Inside a Form:
- Added a `List` view inside a form to display a collection of items in an organized manner.
- Ensured the list was integrated seamlessly within the form to maintain a cohesive layout.

## What I learned:
- **Picker View Integration**
- **List Usage in Forms**

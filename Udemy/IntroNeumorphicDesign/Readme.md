# SwiftUI Course - Section 27: Neumorphic Design Using SwiftUI

## What was done:
Section 27 of the SwiftUI course focused on implementing Neumorphic design elements to create visually appealing and interactive UI components.

## How it was done:
### Creating NeumorphicImageButton:
- Developed a custom `NeumorphicImageButton` component that features a soft, raised effect, characteristic of Neumorphic design.
- Applied Neumorphic design principles to style the button with subtle shadows and highlights.

### Adding Tap Gesture to NeumorphicImage:
- Implemented a tap gesture recognizer for the `NeumorphicImage` to handle user interactions.
- Ensured the button responds to tap events, providing visual feedback to users.

### Improving Animation by Changing Scale and Shadow:
- Enhanced the animation of the NeumorphicImageButton by adjusting its scale and shadow properties.
- Created smooth, visually appealing transitions that occur when the button is tapped, simulating a press effect.

## What I learned:
- **Neumorphic Design Principles**
- **Custom Button Creation**
- **Gesture Handling**
- **Advanced Animations**

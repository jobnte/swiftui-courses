# SwiftUI Course - Section 19  SwiftUI Recipes

## What was done:
This section of the SwiftUI course focused on integrating UIKit components within SwiftUI applications using `UIViewControllerRepresentable`

## How it was done:
### Using UIViewControllerRepresentable:
- Implemented `UIViewControllerRepresentable` to integrate UIKit components into SwiftUI views.
- Demonstrated the setup and usage of `UIViewControllerRepresentable` for presenting UIKit view controllers in SwiftUI.

### Using Coordinator for UIViewControllerRepresentable:
- Applied the Coordinator pattern to manage the interactions and data flow between SwiftUI and UIKit components.
- Ensured efficient communication and delegation between the SwiftUI view and the represented UIKit view controller.

### Presenting ImagePicker as Sheet:
- Implemented an `ImagePicker` using `UIViewControllerRepresentable`.
- Presented the `ImagePicker` as a sheet to allow users to select images from their photo library.
- Managed the image selection and dismissal of the sheet using the Coordinator pattern.

## What I learned:
- **UIViewControllerRepresentable**
- **Image Picker Integration**

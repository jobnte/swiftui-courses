# SwiftUI Course - Section 19: SwiftUI Recipes

## What was done:
Section 19 of the SwiftUI course focused on practical recipes for common tasks in SwiftUI, specifically on grouping data within a `List`.

## How it was done:
### Grouping Data in SwiftUI List:
- Implemented techniques to group data within a `List` for a more organized and structured display.
- Used SwiftUI's built-in functionality to create sections and headers, making the data easier to navigate and understand.

## What I learned:
- **Data Grouping in Lists**
- **Section Headers**

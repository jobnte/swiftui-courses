# SwiftUI Course - Section 21: SwiftUI Animations

## What was done:
Section 21 of the SwiftUI course focused on implementing various animation techniques to enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of SwiftUI applications.

## How it was done:
### Using Default Animation to Rotate Images:
- Applied the `.animation(.default)` modifier to rotate images smoothly.
- Demonstrated the use of default animation for simple transitions.

### Using .easeIn and .easeOut Animations:
- Implemented `.easeIn` and `.easeOut` animations to control the speed of transitions, making them start slowly and end quickly, or vice versa.

### Using Spring and InterpolatingSpring Animations:
- Applied `.spring` animation for bouncy, natural transitions.
- Used `.interpolatingSpring` animation to achieve more control over the spring behavior, including stiffness and damping.

### Implementing Basic Notification View with Spring Animation:
- Created a notification view that appears and disappears with a spring animation for a lively effect.

### Combining Multiple Animations:
- Combined different animation types to create complex, multi-stage animations.
- Demonstrated the use of combined animations to achieve sophisticated visual effects.

## What I learned:
- **Default Animations**
- **EaseIn/EaseOut Animations**
- **Spring Animations**
- **Notification Views**
- **Combining Animations**

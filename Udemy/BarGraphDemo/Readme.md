# SwiftUI Course - Section 12 Building Custom Views with SwiftUI

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing the graph view by aligning elements, dynamically creating bar views, and adding animations.

## How it was done:
### Aligning HStack Bottom Baseline:
- Aligned the `HStack` to the bottom baseline to ensure consistent and visually appealing layout of the bar views.

### Iterating Array to Create BarViews:
- Iterated over an array to dynamically create `BarView` components within the graph view.
- Ensured each bar view was correctly positioned and displayed based on the data.

### Adding Default and Spring Animations:
- Applied default and spring animations to the graph view for smooth transitions.

## What I learned:
- **Layout Alignment**
- **Dynamic View Creation**
- **Animations in SwiftUI**

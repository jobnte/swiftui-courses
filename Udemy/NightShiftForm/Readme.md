# SwiftUI Course - Section 15: Forms

## What was done:
Section 15 of the SwiftUI course focused on using forms to create interactive and organized user interfaces. Key components integrated into forms include toggles, navigation links, and sliders.

## How it was done:
### Using Forms:
- Implemented a `Form` to organize various UI elements.
- Displayed interactive `Toggles` within the form to allow users to switch settings on and off.
- Added `NavigationLinks` to facilitate navigation to different views from within the form.
- Incorporated `Sliders` to enable users to adjust values dynamically within the form.

## What I learned:
- **Form Usage**
- **Toggle Integration**
- **NavigationLink Implementation**
- **Slider Configuration**

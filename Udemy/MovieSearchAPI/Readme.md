# SwiftUI Course - Section 38: What's New in SwiftUI for iOS 15

## What was done:
Section 38 of the SwiftUI course focused on new features introduced in iOS 15, specifically the use of async/await for performing search tasks and the MainActor for updating the UI.

## How it was done:
### Using Async/Await to Perform Search Tasks:
- Implemented async/await to handle search tasks asynchronously, improving readability and efficiency in asynchronous operations.

### Using MainActor to Update UI:
- Utilized the MainActor attribute to ensure UI updates are performed on the main thread, maintaining thread safety and ensuring a responsive user interface.

## What I learned:
- **Async/Await for Search Tasks**
- **MainActor for UI Updates**

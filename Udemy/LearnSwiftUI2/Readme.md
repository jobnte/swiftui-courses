# SwiftUI Course - Basic Usage of Components

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on the basic implementation and usage of several SwiftUI components: `TextEditor`, `DatePicker`, and `ColorPicker`.

## How it was done:
### Using TextEditor:
- Implemented `TextEditor` to enable multi-line text input within the application.
- Bound the entered text to state variables to demonstrate dynamic updates.

### Using DatePicker:
- Implemented `DatePicker` to allow users to select dates.
- Bound the selected date to state variables for dynamic date handling.
- Configured `DatePicker` to display different date formats and modes.

### Using ColorPicker:
- Implemented `ColorPicker` to allow users to select colors.
- Bound the selected color to state variables to update the UI dynamically.

## What I learned:
- **TextEditor**
- **DatePicker**
- **ColorPicker**

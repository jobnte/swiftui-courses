## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on understanding and implementing the basics of `@StateObject` to manage state in SwiftUI applications.

## How it was done:
### Understanding @StateObject:
- Introduced the `@StateObject` property wrapper to manage the lifecycle of observable objects within SwiftUI views.
- Demonstrated how to create and use a `@StateObject` to maintain consistent state management across view updates.
- Explained the differences between `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@EnvironmentObject` for managing state.

## What I learned:
- **@StateObject Basics**: Gained a foundational understanding of the `@StateObject` property wrapper and its role in state management.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Learned how `@StateObject` helps manage the lifecycle of observable objects, ensuring they are created and retained correctly within views.
- **State Consistency**: Acquired skills in using `@StateObject` to maintain consistent state across view updates, improving the reliability and performance of SwiftUI applications.

# SwiftUI Course - Section 31: Building a Beautiful Credit Card UI

## What was done:
Section 31 of the SwiftUI course focused on building a visually appealing credit card UI with various styling and animation techniques.

## How it was done:
### Styling View with Gradients:
- Applied gradient backgrounds to enhance the visual appeal of the credit card view.

### Creating a Wrapper for Credit Card View Content:
- Developed a wrapper to organize and structure the content within the credit card view.

### Performing Rotation Animation on Tap:
- Implemented a rotation animation using `rotation3DEffect(degrees)` to animate the card when tapped.
- Utilized `withAnimation` closure for smooth and responsive animations.

### Binding TextField for User Input:
- Bound `TextField` to state variables to capture and display user input dynamically.

# SwiftUI Course - Section 28 - SwiftUI - iOS 14 - Xcode 12

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on implementing advanced grid layouts using `LazyVGrid`, including fixed-size grid items, scrolling, and sticky headers.

## How it was done:
### Using LazyVGrid:
- Implemented `LazyVGrid` to create an efficient and flexible grid layout.
- Configured the grid with various item sizes and spacing to demonstrate its versatility.

### Using .fixed GridItem:
- Utilized `.fixed` GridItem to create grid elements with fixed sizes.
- Ensured that the grid items maintained consistent dimensions regardless of content size.

### Scroll in LazyVGrid by Wrapping it in a ScrollView:
- Enabled scrolling functionality by wrapping the `LazyVGrid` in a `ScrollView`.
- Allowed users to scroll through the grid vertically, enhancing the user experience with large datasets.

### Use of Sticky Headers in Grid:
- Implemented sticky headers within the grid to keep section headers visible while scrolling.
- Enhanced the grid layout by maintaining context with persistent headers.

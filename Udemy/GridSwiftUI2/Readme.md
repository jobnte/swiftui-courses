# SwiftUI Course - Using LazyVGrid, ProgressView and Timer

## What was done:
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on implementing `LazyVGrid` to create efficient vertical grid layouts.
This part of the SwiftUI course focused on implementing `ProgressView` and using `Timer` to update it in real-time.

## How it was done:
### Using LazyVGrid:
- Implemented `LazyVGrid` to arrange items in a vertical grid layout.
- Configured the grid with various item sizes and spacing to demonstrate its flexibility and efficiency.

### Using ProgressView:
- Implemented `ProgressView` to visually display progress within the application.
- Configured `ProgressView` with different styles and progress values.

## What I learned:
- **LazyVGrid Implementation**
- **Efficient Layout Management**
- **ProgressView Implementation**
- **Timer Utilization**

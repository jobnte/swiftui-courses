# SwiftUI Course - Section 4: Building Grid Layout in SwiftUI

## What was done:
This lesson focused on displaying a grid layout using `ForEach` and `HStack` in SwiftUI.

## How it was done:
### Displaying a Grid Using ForEach and HStack:
- Utilized `ForEach` to iterate over data and create grid elements.
- Used `HStack` to arrange items horizontally within each row of the grid.
- Combined multiple `HStack` instances to form the complete grid layout.

## What I learned:
- **Grid Layouts with ForEach and HStack**
- **Dynamic UI Construction**: Learned to dynamically construct and manage grid layouts in SwiftUI for a more organized and visually appealing interface.

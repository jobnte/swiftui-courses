# SwiftUI Course - Section 33: Good Weather App - Displaying the Weather

## What was done:
Section 33 of the SwiftUI course focused on displaying weather data in the Good Weather App, utilizing various SwiftUI techniques and implementing the MVVM pattern.

## How it was done:
### Creating Extensions:
- Developed extensions for `Date`, `String`, `UserDefaults`, and `View` to enhance functionality and reuse code efficiently.

### Creating Constants Class:
- Created a constants class to store the API endpoints for easy access and management.

### Setting Up Authorization for OpenWeatherMap API:
- Configured the application to authorize and interact with the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.

### Downloading Images Using ImageLoader Custom Class:
- Implemented an `ImageLoader` custom class to handle image downloading and caching, ensuring efficient image loading within the app.

### Implementing MVVM Pattern:
- Applied the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to structure the app's architecture, promoting a clear separation of concerns and improving maintainability.

## What I learned:
- **Extensions for Date, String, UserDefaults, and View**
- **Constants Class for API Endpoints**
- **OpenWeatherMap API Authorization**
- **ImageLoader Custom Class**
- **MVVM Pattern Implementation**

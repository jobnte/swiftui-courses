# SwiftUI Course - Section 36: NearMe App - Displaying Nearby Landmarks

## What was done:
Section 36 of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing the NearMe App to display nearby landmarks based on the user's location.

## How it was done:
### Searching Landmarks Using MKLocalSearch API:
- Implemented landmark search functionality using the `MKLocalSearch` API to find nearby points of interest.

### Using LocationManager to Track User's Location:
- Integrated `LocationManager` to track and update the user's current location in real-time.

## What I learned:
- **Landmark Search with MKLocalSearch API**
- **Using LocationManager for User Location Tracking**

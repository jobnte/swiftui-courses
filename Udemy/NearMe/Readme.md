# SwiftUI Course - Section 36 & 37: NearMe App - Displaying Nearby Landmarks & Adding User Interface Improvements

## What was done:
Sections 36 and 37 of the SwiftUI course focused on enhancing the NearMe App to display nearby landmarks based on the user's location and improving the user interface.

## How it was done:
### Searching Landmarks Using MKLocalSearch API:
- Implemented landmark search functionality using the `MKLocalSearch` API to find nearby points of interest.

### Using LocationManager to Track User's Location:
- Integrated `LocationManager` to track and update the user's current location in real-time.

### Implementing Picker to Change Item Presentation:
- Added a `Picker` to allow users to switch between map and list views for displaying landmarks.

### Adding Default Categories to Search on the Map:
- Added predefined categories to facilitate searching for specific types of landmarks on the map.

## What I learned:
- **Landmark Search with MKLocalSearch API**
- **Using LocationManager for User Location Tracking**
- **Implementing Picker for View Switching**
- **Adding Default Search Categories**

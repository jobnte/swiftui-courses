# SwiftUI Course - Section 19: SwiftUI Recipes

## What was done:
Section 19 of the SwiftUI course focused on practical recipes for creating custom views, specifically implementing a `BarChartView` using `Rectangle` and `HStack`.

## How it was done:
### Implementing BarChartView:
- Created a custom `BarChartView` to visualize data using `Rectangle` and `HStack`.
- Used `HStack` to layout the bars horizontally.
- Applied various modifiers to the `Rectangle` elements to style the bars and represent different data values.

## What I learned:
- **Custom View Creation**
- **Bar Chart Implementation**
- **View Modifiers**

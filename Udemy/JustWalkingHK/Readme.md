# SwiftUI Course - Section 30: SwiftUI HealthKit Integration

## What was done:
Section 30 of the SwiftUI course focused on integrating HealthKit to read and display health data, specifically the user's steps over the past days.

## How it was done:
### Using HKHealthStore:
- Implemented `HKHealthStore` to enable HealthKit integration within the SwiftUI application.

### Querying Data from HKStatisticsCollectionQuery:
- Used `HKStatisticsCollectionQuery` to query and read the number of steps taken by the user over the past days.
- Demonstrated how to process and display this historical data in the application.

### Configuring Project to Use HealthKit:
- Configured the project settings to request and access HealthKit data.
- Ensured necessary permissions and capabilities were set up for HealthKit usage.

### Recap of BarChart:
- Reviewed the implementation of a BarChart to visually represent the queried step data.
- Displayed the historical step data using a BarChart for easy interpretation.

## What I learned:
- **HKHealthStore**
- **HKStatisticsCollectionQuery**
- **HealthKit Project Configuration**
- **BarChart Implementation**

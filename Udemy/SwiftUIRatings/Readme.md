# SwiftUI Course - Section 28: SwiftUI - iOS 14 - Xcode 12

## What was done:
Section 28 of the SwiftUI course focused on new features introduced in iOS 14 and Xcode 12, specifically the use of `LibraryContentProvider` for custom views and utilizing modifiers in extensions.

## How it was done:
### Using LibraryContentProvider for Custom Views:
- Implemented `LibraryContentProvider` to create and manage custom views.
- Enabled easy reuse and accessibility of custom views within the Xcode library.

### Use of Modifiers in Extensions:
- Created custom modifiers by extending existing SwiftUI views.
- Enhanced reusability and maintainability of code by encapsulating common view modifications within extensions.

## What I learned:
- **LibraryContentProvider**: Gained experience in using `LibraryContentProvider` to create custom views and make them easily accessible within the Xcode library.
- **Custom Modifiers**: Learned to create and apply custom modifiers by extending SwiftUI views, improving code reusability and maintainability.

# SwiftUI Course - Section 28: SwiftUI - iOS 14 - Xcode 12

## What was done:
Section 28 of the SwiftUI course focused on storing custom objects in `AppStorage` using `Data` and `JSONDecoder`/`JSONEncoder`.

## How it was done:
### Storing Custom Objects in AppStorage:
- Implemented storing custom objects in `AppStorage` by converting them to `Data`.
- Used `JSONEncoder` to encode custom objects to JSON format and store them in `AppStorage`.
- Used `JSONDecoder` to decode JSON data back into custom objects when retrieving from `AppStorage`.

## What I learned:
- **Storing Custom Objects in AppStorage**
- **JSONEncoder and JSONDecoder**

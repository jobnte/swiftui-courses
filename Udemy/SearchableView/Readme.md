# SwiftUI Course - Section 38: What's New in SwiftUI for iOS 15

## What was done:
Section 38 of the SwiftUI course focused on new features introduced in iOS 15, specifically the use of the `.searchable` modifier and the `.onSubmit(of: .search)` modifier.

## How it was done:
### Using .searchable Modifier:
- Implemented the `.searchable` modifier to integrate search functionality directly into SwiftUI views.
- Demonstrated how to configure `.searchable` for responsive and intuitive search experiences.

### Using .onSubmit(of: .search) Modifier:
- Implemented the `.onSubmit(of: .search)` modifier to handle search submissions efficiently.
- Showed how to respond to search input and trigger actions upon submission.

## What I learned:
- **.searchable Modifier**
- **.onSubmit(of: .search) Modifier**

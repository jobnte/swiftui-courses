# SwiftUI Course - Section 39: More Videos

## What was done:
Section 39 of the SwiftUI course focused on creating a drawing application using Canvas and capturing painting locations using drag gestures.

## How it was done:
### Creating Drawing Application Using Canvas:
- Implemented a drawing application utilizing the Canvas view to render drawings.
- Configured the Canvas to allow freeform drawing within the SwiftUI application.

### Getting the Location of Painting from Drag Gesture:
- Captured the location of the user's painting strokes using the drag gesture.
- Used the drag gesture data to update the Canvas in real-time, reflecting the user's input.

## What I learned:
- **Drawing with Canvas**
- **Capturing Drag Gesture for Painting**

# SwiftUI Course - Section 19: SwiftUI Recipes

## What was done:
Section 19 of the SwiftUI course included practical recipes for integrating UIKit components and enhancing SwiftUI applications with search functionality.

## How it was done:
### Using UIViewRepresentable to Display a SearchBar:
- Implemented `UIViewRepresentable` to integrate a UIKit `UISearchBar` within a SwiftUI view.
- Demonstrated the setup and usage of `UIViewRepresentable` for presenting and configuring the search bar.

### Performing Basic Search Operation:
- Implemented a basic search functionality to filter an array of data based on user input from the search bar.
- Ensured the filtered results were dynamically displayed within a SwiftUI view.

## What I learned:
- **UIViewRepresentable for SearchBar**
- **Basic Search Functionality**

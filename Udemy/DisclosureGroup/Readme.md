# SwiftUI Course - Section 28: SwiftUI - iOS 14 - Xcode 12

## What was done:
Section 28 of the SwiftUI course focused on new features introduced in iOS 14 and Xcode 12, specifically the use of `DisclosureGroup` to create expandable views and understanding the difference between `OutlineGroup` and `DisclosureGroup`.

## How it was done:
### Using DisclosureGroup to Show Expandable Views:
- Implemented `DisclosureGroup` to create views that can be expanded or collapsed.
- Demonstrated how to use `DisclosureGroup` for organizing and presenting expandable content.

### Understanding the Difference Between OutlineGroup and DisclosureGroup:
- Explained the use cases and differences between `OutlineGroup` and `DisclosureGroup`.
  - `OutlineGroup` is used for displaying hierarchical data structures and automatically manages the expansion and collapse of nested items.
  - `DisclosureGroup` is used for creating custom expandable sections where the developer has more control over the content and presentation.

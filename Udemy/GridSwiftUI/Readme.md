# SwiftUI Course - Section 4: Building Grid Layout in SwiftUI

## What was done:
This lesson focused on building a grid layout in SwiftUI:
1. **Showing a Matrix in a View**
2. **Array Chunking with Stride**
3. **Using Slider View**

## How it was done:
### Showing a Matrix in a View:
- Utilized `List` and `ForEach` to present a matrix layout within a view.
- Ensured the matrix was displayed correctly, with each row containing multiple items.

### Array Chunking with Stride:
- Created an extension method for arrays using `stride` to chunk the array into smaller slices.
- Applied this method to manage and display data efficiently within the grid layout.

### Using Slider View:
- Added a slider view to allow dynamic adjustment of content within the matrix.
- Linked the slider value to the data source to demonstrate real-time updates and adjustments.

## What I learned:
- **Grid Layouts in SwiftUI**
- **Array Manipulation**
- **Dynamic UI Elements**

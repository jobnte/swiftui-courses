# SwiftUI Course - Section 16: Modals

## What was done:
Section 16 of the SwiftUI course focused on implementing modals using the `.sheet` modifier to present views and pass data efficiently.

## How it was done:
### Basic Usage of .sheet:
- Utilized the `.sheet` modifier to present modal views.
- Demonstrated the basic setup and presentation of a sheet in SwiftUI.

### Passing Data to a View in a Sheet:
- Implemented data passing to views presented within a sheet.
- Ensured that the modal views received and displayed the necessary data.

### Use of ViewModel to Pass Data to Detail View:
- Created and utilized a `ViewModel` to manage and pass data to detail views within a sheet.
- Demonstrated how to structure and use a `ViewModel` for efficient data handling and state management.

## What I learned:
- **Modal Presentation with .sheet**
- **Data Passing in Modals**

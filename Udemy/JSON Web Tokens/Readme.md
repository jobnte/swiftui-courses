# SwiftUI Course - Section 35: Authentication in SwiftUI Using JSON Web Tokens

## What was done:
Section 35 of the SwiftUI course focused on implementing authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## How it was done:
### Setting Up a Server Using Glitch:
- Used Glitch to set up a server and create a basic API for handling authentication.

### Implementing Client-Side Login:
- Note: This section did not include storing tokens in the keychain or additional security measures so I skipped the client side.

## What I learned:
- **Server Setup with Glitch**
- **Basic API Creation**

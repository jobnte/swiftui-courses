# SwiftUI Course - Section 38: What's New in SwiftUI for iOS 15

## What was done:
Section 38 of the SwiftUI course focused on new features introduced in iOS 15, specifically related to modern concurrency and asynchronous programming.

## How it was done:
### Learning About Async/Await:
- Studied the new async/await syntax for handling asynchronous tasks more efficiently and readably.

### Learning About withUnsafeContinuation and withCheckedContinuation:
- Explored `withUnsafeContinuation` and `withCheckedContinuation` to manage continuations and bridge async code with callback-based APIs.

### Using Async Closures:
- Implemented async closures to perform asynchronous operations within SwiftUI views.

### Using MainActor:
- Utilized the `MainActor` attribute to ensure that UI updates occur on the main thread, maintaining thread safety and UI responsiveness.

## What I learned:
- **Async/Await**
- **withUnsafeContinuation and withCheckedContinuation**
- **Async Closures**
- **MainActor**

# SwiftUI Course - Basic Usage of CoreData in SwiftUI

## What was done:
This section of the SwiftUI course focused on integrating CoreData for data persistence within a SwiftUI application.

## How it was done:
### Basic Setup of CoreData:
- Integrated CoreData into the SwiftUI project to enable data persistence.
- Configured the CoreData stack, including the managed object context, persistent container, and data model.

### Basic Usage of CoreData:
- Demonstrated how to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations using CoreData.
- Implemented a simple user interface to interact with CoreData entities.
- Ensured data persisted between app launches by leveraging CoreDataâ€™s storage capabilities.

## What I learned:
- **CoreData Integration**
- **CRUD Operations**
- **Persistent Storage**
